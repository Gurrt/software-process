# Power

##Healthcare.gov

Assignment failed case: 
>Analyse for the failed case to what extent people get the right amount of power. Take into account: to what extent control is adequate, how power is balanced and how the context of a learning environment is of impact. 

###Point of views

####Thoughts without facts:
I think politics had to do a lot with the failing of the case. Democrates wanted to get Obamacare to go live whatever it takes and the Republicans want to stop it. 

It is strange that in on April 4, 2013 a 15-page document by McKinsey & Co. warns among others the CMS administrator that there was insufficient end-to-end testing and advises that a limited initial launch of the website would be ideal. It seems nothing is done with this report, because it surfaced only half November 2013. One and a half month after the lauch. Next to that there were only two weeks of end-to-end testing before the launch took place for all the users.

Also other reports and warnings were discarded like that the website as of September 30 could handle only about 1100 users at a time, even though officials have said it should have been abble to accomodate perhaps as many as 60,000 users 

#####Questions to answer:

Who were involved?
Who was responsible for what?
What could everyone have done to make it a succes or to make the project a failure?

Why was the quality of the product so low? Especially if there were so much professionals were involved?
Where there cultural differences between Washington vs Sillicon Valley (East vs West coast) (government mentality vs company mentality)??????
Was Quality Software Services (QSS) the best company to choose for creating the website for 165 million dollars? Could have been a friend service of the Obama administration?
Did QSS indirectly supported the presidential campaign of Obama?

##Scrum
Scrum evangelizes empowerment.
The Scrum team is self-organizing and structured and empowered by the organization to manage their  own work.
The development team decides how to do the work.
In Scrum, accountability lies within the whole team.
The team creates a definition of done, which controls the level of quality of the product.
This also leads to a lack of control, that the management can exert.

Dan Ariely experimented with motivation and found out, that people are more productive when they receive feedback on their work.
In his experiment, he let people write down the double letters on a sheet of random letters. They tracked how many sheets the subjects would finish. They experimented with three conditions for receiving the paper from the subject:
- In the first condition, the experimentor would receive the paper, look at it and nod and add it to the stack of finished papers.
- In the second condition, the experimentor would not look at the paper and simply add it to the stack of finished papers.
- In the third condition, the experimentor would shred the paper in front of the subjects eyes.
The result of this experiment is, that the subjects in the first condition finished a lot more papers than the subjects in the third.
The people in the second condition did better than the ones in the third, but not by much[Ariely].
At the end of each sprint in Scrum, there is a sprint review, in which stakeholders give feedback. 
Considering the results of the experiments of Ariely, this should increase the motivation of the team.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that Scrum and agile practises increase productivity[Cardozo][Diebold][Robiolo][Monteiro].
One thing to be considered, is that in this experiment, motivation lead to more productivity, but they only looked at when the subjects gave up, not at the amount of time spent.
This leaves open the question whether a high motivation makes you more productive given a fixed timeframe.
The impact of motivation on performance is a complex matter. Recognition of ones work is proven to impact performance [Uzonna]
