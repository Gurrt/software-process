# Power

##Healthcare.gov

Assignment failed case: 
>Analyse for the failed case to what extent people get the right amount of power. Take into account: to what extent control is adequate, how power is balanced and how the context of a learning environment is of impact. 

###Point of views

####Thoughts without facts:
I think politics had to do a lot with the failing of the case. Democrates wanted to get Obamacare to go live whatever it takes and the Republicans want to stop it. 

It is strange that in on April 4, 2013 a 15-page document by McKinsey & Co. warns among others the CMS administrator that there was insufficient end-to-end testing and advises that a limited initial launch of the website would be ideal. It seems nothing is done with this report, because it surfaced only half November 2013. One and a half month after the lauch. Next to that there were only two weeks of end-to-end testing before the launch took place for all the users.

Also other reports and warnings were discarded like that the website as of September 30 could handle only about 1100 users at a time, even though officials have said it should have been abble to accomodate perhaps as many as 60,000 users 

#####Questions to answer:

Who were involved?
Who was responsible for what?
What could everyone have done to make it a succes or to make the project a failure?

Why was the quality of the product so low? Especially if there were so much professionals were involved?
Where there cultural differences between Washington vs Sillicon Valley (East vs West coast) (government mentality vs company mentality)??????
Was Quality Software Services (QSS) the best company to choose for creating the website for 165 million dollars? Could have been a friend service of the Obama administration?
Did QSS indirectly supported the presidential campaign of Obama?
