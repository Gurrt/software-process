# Power

##HealthCare.gov out of control

Assignment failed case: 
>Analyse for the failed case to what extent people get the right amount of power. Take into account: to what extent control is adequate, how power is balanced and how the context of a learning environment is of impact. 

###Context
On 23 March 2010, president Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. One of the consequences of this law was that everyone in the USA would require access to a health insurance marketplace. Therefore the federal government started the HealtCare.gov project. The implementation of the law depended crucially on this website. It was therefore imperative for the Democratic party to make this project a success. On the other hand the Republican party opposed and still opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). 

######Federal shutdown
One of the biggest clashes of this conflict was the United States federal government shutdown that came into effect on the 1st of October 2013. The shutdown was into effect because the U.S. debt-ceiling was reached and the Repulican-controlled House of Representatives did not want to raise this ceiling. The main reason was to delay or defund Obamacare. On the 17th of October 2013 the shutdown ended when the Repulicans agreeded with raising the debt-ceiling.


######Stakeholders & Contractors
The stakeholders were according to [4, page 6]: the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), 36 States, 300 private insurers, U.S. Chief Technology Office, GAO, Media, Citizens, Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Peace Corps, etc.

The construction of HealthCare.gov was overseen by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which is a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The primary contractor was CGI Federal who had a contract of around 250 million dollars. Next to that there were 16 official subcontractors, but the total number of subcontractors was actually 55. All under the supervison of CMS. There were also 300 private insurers. All in all there were around 4000 plans.



### Who was in control?

######CMS
CMS was responsible for the overall coordination and planning of the project. But it did fail according to reports of the office of inspector general.


According to one report [1] there were inadequacies in contract planning and procurement. The report states: <i>“When awarding the Federal Marketplace contracts, CMS did not always meet contracting requirements. For example, CMS did not develop an overarching acquisition strategy for the Federal Marketplace or perform all required oversight activities. Moreover, for a project of this size and importance, CMS missed opportunities to leverage all available acquisition planning tools and contracting approaches to identify and mitigate risks. Specifically, CMS did not exercise the option to plan for a lead systems integrator to coordinate all contractors’ efforts prior to the launch of the Federal Marketplace. The complexity of the Federal Marketplace underscored the need for CMS to select the most qualified contractors. However, CMS did not perform thorough reviews of contractor past performance when awarding two key contracts. CMS also made contracting decisions that may have limited the number of acceptable proposals for much of the key Federal Marketplace work. In addition, CMS selected contract types that placed the risk of cost increases for this work solely on the Government.“ </i>. 

According to another report of the office of inspector general [3] CMS did not alway manage and oversee the contractor performance. The main problem in this case is the lack of control on the contract deliverables.

######Obama administration
Also the Obama administration, did not make this project easy, it kept modifying regulations and policies of the Affordable Care Act [1], which inherently meant that the scope of the HealthCare.gov website kept changing too. Which probably has caused some hardship with the changes trickling down to all the contractors, but there is a lack of documentation on how the changes were documented and implemented.


#######Culture: Alienative, Calculative vs. Moral involvement
Etzioni [6] [7] developed the compliance theory. He classifies organizations by the type of power they use to direct the behavior of their members and the type of involvement of the participants. He identified three types of organizational power: coercive, utilitarian, and normative, and relates these respectively to three types of involvement: alienative, calculative, and moral.  


(still need to written coupling between Etzioni theory and culture in Washington DC)

According to Robert Kennedy [8] a Google employee that worked in is free time in Washington DC at the HealthCare.gov project, people were afraid of making mistakes because they could be fired for it. This way people did not raise any mistakes that they made and therefore the problems that resulted from these mistakes couldn’t be easily resolved.

It seems that this culture of fear resulted that on vital reports were not reacted on the right way. For example on April 4, 2013 a 15-page document by McKinsey & Co. warns among others the CMS administrator that there was insufficient end-to-end testing and advises that a limited initial launch of the website would be ideal. This reports surfaced only half November 2013. One and a half month after the lauch. The advise in this report was not followed, because there were only two weeks of end-to-end testing before the launch took place for all the users and there was no limited initial lauch. Also other reports and warnings were discarded like that the website as of September 30 could handle only about 1100 users at a time, even though officials have said it should have been able to accomodate perhaps as many as 60,000 users. It seems that people were afraid to be fired or were afraid that the Republicans would use such reports to try to delay or cancel the whole project and with that the whole Obamacare bill.


Robert Kennedy [8] also stated that he met with an employee of one of the site contractors who was in charge of software “security.” When he asked her which penetration threats she had prepared for, she responded that she didn’t think about such things: she was in charge of “risk assessment.”


###Conflict of interest

#####UnitedHealth Group
In 2012 the UnitedHealth Group (a healthcare insurance company), took over
Quality Software Services (QSS). QSS was one of the contractors of the website. The contract was worth 165 million dollars. This way it was possible for QSS to let the UnitedHealth Group with the name UnitedHealthcare gaining an advantage over other healthcare insurance companies who also are clients of the HealthCare.gov website.

##########Notes of Alex (don’t take these into account)
<b>What could everyone have done to make it a succes or to make the project a failure?</b>
<b>Why was the quality of the product so low? Especially if there were so much professionals were involved?</b>

Trust vs Control
"Trust is good, but control is better." (Vladimir Lenin)

##Scrum
Scrum evangelizes empowerment.
The Scrum team is self-organizing and structured and empowered by the organization to manage their  own work.
The development team decides how to do the work.
In Scrum, accountability lies within the whole team.
The team creates a definition of done, which controls the level of quality of the product.
This also leads to a lack of control, that the management can exert.

Dan Ariely experimented with motivation and found out, that people are more productive when they receive feedback on their work.
In his experiment, he let people write down the double letters on a sheet of random letters. They tracked how many sheets the subjects would finish. They experimented with three conditions for receiving the paper from the subject:
- In the first condition, the experimentor would receive the paper, look at it and nod and add it to the stack of finished papers.
- In the second condition, the experimentor would not look at the paper and simply add it to the stack of finished papers.
- In the third condition, the experimentor would shred the paper in front of the subjects eyes.

The result of this experiment is, that the subjects in the first condition finished a lot more papers than the subjects in the third.
The people in the second condition did better than the ones in the third, but not by much[Ariely].
At the end of each sprint in Scrum, there is a sprint review, in which stakeholders give feedback. 
Considering the results of the experiments of Ariely, this should increase the motivation of the team.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that Scrum and agile practises increase productivity[Cardozo][Diebold][Robiolo][Monteiro].
One thing to be considered, is that in this experiment, motivation lead to more productivity, but they only looked at when the subjects gave up, not at the amount of time spent.
This leaves open the question whether a high motivation makes you more productive given a fixed timeframe.
The impact of motivation on performance is a complex matter. Recognition of ones work is proven to impact performance [Uzonna]
