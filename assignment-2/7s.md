#7S Framework.

> Assignment - 7S:
> Organisations are not just about methodology. There are quite a number of abstractions for organisations. We will look at the 7S model. Now we go and look outside to two successful companies through the eyes of the 7S model. You can select these companies. One should be a software company, one should come from another industry. What can you learn from this for your failed case? What can you learn from this about the methods RUP and Scrum.
> 
> Look for organisations that really make clear how they work from the inside. Think about Etsy, Quora, Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, Amazon, Spotify.

## 1. Introduction.
7S is a management model developed by  R.H. Waterman Jr. and T.Peters. The 7 Ss are structure, strategy, systems, skills, style, staff and shared values. The model is most often used as an organizational analysis tool to assess and monitor changes in the internal situation of an organization

* *Principles* .- (think about measures that will improve performance).
The core idea lays on the question "How I distribute my sources in order to get the best results and create some value?".
The seven elements need to be aligned and helping each other in order to hold performance at the host organization, and organizations must be align with external enviroment. 
The model can help to identify non aligned issues at critical moments like during changes at the organization. Also to clarify some of the key issues that must be addressed for such organizations to be effective and adaptive.


* *Objectives* .- 
**Strategy** : What makes the organization special?. Ones such question is answer of course based on the organization vison statement. The next step is to identify the kind of problems the organization addresses on its functional areas, aiming to enhance its competitive advantage. 

**Structure**: How the organization is arranged or configured? For example some organizations are divided for their geographical distribution, others for its functionalities, others focussed on their main production, aiming to clarify its integration and coordination mechanisms.

**Systems**:  It refers to the formal procedures for measurement, rules and processes for getting things done and managing the activity of the organization. They include personnel evaluation , rewards, performance assessments, chain-ofcommand relationships, policies for planning, monitoring, and executing projects.

**Staffing**: It refers to organization's human resources and how they are recruited, selected, and trained to perform their jobs, aiming to choose what is best for its demographic, educational and attitudinal characteristics.

**Skills**:  What is the organization good at, and what special skills and competencies are found its people, and at the organization itself?. Aiming to identify organization's core competencies and distinctive capabilities.

**Style**: How do the leaders interact with subordinates and others in the organization, and how do members interact with each other?. Aiming to identify typical behavior patterns of key groups.

**Shared values**: Are the underlying principles or ideas that provide meaning and purpose in an organization.

* *Limitations* .-
When something is misaligned , what are the step to follow?

## 2. Through the eyes of 7S model.

* **2.1 Software industry:**

### Spotify

Spotify is a commercial music streaming, podcast and video service, founded in april 2006 by Daniel Ek, Martin Lorentzon. Spotify was launched in September 2008 and by June 2015 Spotify had more than 75 million active users, including about 20 million paid users. 

##### Strategy

In order to answer the question, What make spotify special?
- Two music streaming tiers: Spotify Free ( a lot advertisements) and Spotify Premium ( paid, remove advertisements, improve audio quality, download available), this is called 'freemium pricing strategy'.
- Spotify pays artists based on their 'market share' (the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service). They distribute approximately 70% to rights-holders.
- Other competitors in the market like Grooveshark have been shut down as part of legal settlements, because strategies that did not compensate the music production, Spotify even having some artist criticism, has manage to hold some balance between their activities and the music production industry.

##### Structure

Spotify headquarters resides in London and its handles, research and development departments are in Stockholm.
Like many other matrix management organizations, Spotify subdivides the work among people with similar skills, and they are pooled for work assignments, resulting in more than one manager with their own responsibilities and competencies. All this managers are from that point, reporting hierarchical button up to the CTO and finally to the CEO.

##### Systems

How things get done? 
according to Spotify [12]: 
- Spotify has a culture based on agile principles, all engineerings happens in squads, they try to keep those squads loosely coupled, tightly aligned.
- They like cross-pollination instead of 'standarization', in order to spread knowledge, trends and tools between squads. It does not break the principal of 'issolated missions' because cross-pollination is used to spread the uses of tools like github for example. 
- Their code is shared on an internal open source model. 
- Squads make small and frequent releases as a routine, which is enable due decoupling their services. 
- Their self-service model pretend minimizes the need for handoffs. 
- They uses release trains and feature toggles aiming get things into production early and often.
- They claim that their culture is based also on the people, therefore the focus on motivation, community and trust rather than structure and control.
- Product development is based on Lean. They release their new features to a small group of customers limiting the 'blast radius' of a possible fail and it allows them to conduce a lot of small experiments. They report that it produces a lot of waste but this can be seen from a Lean perspective.
They have something called 'core metrics data'. The data is feed dynamically due constant experimentation.

##### Staffing

Spotify claims to have a very clear definition of what and how employees careers should develop in order to achieve the most important organization goals.[6]"Everyone in *Spotify tech* should have a way to grow their careers and expand the impact of their -work no matter what role they play".
The Spotify technology career framework, consist on letting the employee transfer itself on as many roles and domain expertise as possible in order to gain experience and later evaluate their impact into the organization.
*On recognition and promotions* Spotify observes constantly the impact someone has at a wider scope, and they have a formal ways to promote their employees
*On setting the step for a new employee* Spotify gives 6 months to all new employees to get involved with their role and the organization.
*On compensation* A formal promotion should lead to higher pay in a straightforward and transparent way.

##### Skills

What is the organization good at?
Spotify seems to be good at keeping their organization dynamic, focusing on their community rather to an hierarchical structure.

##### Style
How do the leaders interact with subordinates and others in the organization?
According with Spotify [12]:
- They have an Agile engineering culture, which means they like servent leaders rather than process masters.
- Autonomy that every member team has over their work have evolve to a high rate percentage of team members satisfaction and they keep investing on it. 
- Autonomy seems also to keep high motivation levels [12 and 13], teams are fast, and their minimize de dependency from and to, other teams.
 
##### Shared Values

Adding more functional and visionary features to their software product.
Keeping the organization as a very nice place to work in.


* **2.2 Non-Software industry:**

### KLM
Note: Most of the information about the leadership comes from talks with my (Ger) father, who is a copilot for KLM. Therefore there are no official sources to cite and the leadership style is largely from a pilot's point of view. So different departments will likely have other styles of internal management.
##### Strategy
KLM's main strategy is to position itself as a luxury brand. In their advertisement they position flying as something
unique and beautiful, instead of focusing on the price of the tickets. Instead of nickle-and-diming their customers for drinks and food like many other airlines, they prefer to just include it in the ticket price. This gives a more luxurious and relaxed feeling during flights. Together with this they also aim for a very user friendly
atmosphere by focusing a great deal of attention to twitter and facebook customer service.
##### Structure
As to be expected of a 32.000 employee company, the structure is very classical and hierarchical.
The executive committe consists out of 13 people [5], each responsible for their subdivison of KLM. This kind of structure is not the best for quick decision making, but it is good at managing very large companies. And tons of independent scrum teams consisting out of all the personnel needed to maintain, supply, staff and fly a plane would most likely become a big mess. Companies like this need big planning departments and overarching management to make decisions on what course of action to take.
##### Systems
The advantage of hierarchical systems is that it is usually very easy to identify the chain of command. Within the airplane everyone answers to the Captain and after that to the second in command. Who again answer to the chief of staff for the type of airplane they are flying. Due to the large amount of pilots (2.600) they rarely see the chief of staff though.  The advantage of this is, that it is easy to get things done, when on a trip the Captain is in charge of all decisions and only when something goes seriously wrong, you have to see your manager.
##### Staffing
A main pro of being a company this big and well known, with a prestigous brand name is that it is not very hard to get the right staff. People know how to find KLM, and this shows. They usually have no open vacancies for aircraft crew. Most open vacancies are usually in the IT field.
##### Skills
As noticed before, a main skill of KLM is customer engagement through Twitter and Facebook, this helps in creating a very friendly brand name. Other skills of note are the international networking and cooperation through the Skyteam network, ensuring that you can reach virtually any destination of the world while flying with KLM or one of their partners.
##### Style
KLM's leadership style is very detached from the 'workfloor'. Captains all have their own style of leadership in their airplane. The main way of influence from higher management is through flight plans and regulations. But as stated earlier, pilots really only see their supervisor once something goes really wrong. So if a captain flies slightly faster than planned, which burns more fuel, to be on their destination earlier that will likely not attract any attention at all.  This means that the area in which leadership has the most influence is in all the supporting acitivities: routes, staff planning, catering, hotels, management, cargo and training.
##### Shared Values
The two Shared Values that KLM hold closest to its heart are: the experience of flying and customer service. In their commercials KLM emphasize the first shared value. In their actions on social media and training of flight crew they pay a great deal of attention to the second shared value
