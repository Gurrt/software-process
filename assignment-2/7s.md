# 7S Framework #

# 1. Introduction #

In this chapter we'll take a look at several successful companies. We use the 7S model as a guidance, to understand the different aspects of these organizations. The first company that we've analyzed is Spotify, a company that became very popular over the last years with their music streaming services. Next, we take a look at KLM, that is in a completely other line of business.

Next, we discuss what practices the companies behind HealtCare.gov, a failed software development case, could have learned from the practices of Spotify and KLM. Also we take a small sidestep and look at Heerema Marine Contractors, a successful offshore company. Although they deal with a completely different business, they've found a way to tackle their complex projects. Their practices may be of interest for companies that need to work together with a lot of subcontractors.

Finally, we discuss whether we can learn something about RUP and Scrum, based on our analysis of Spotify and KLM.

# 2. Looking through the eyes of the 7S model #

## 2.1 Software industry ##

### Spotify

Spotify is a commercial music streaming, podcast and video service, founded in april 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Spotify was launched in September 2008 and by June 2015 Spotify had more than 75 million active users, including about 20 million paid users. 

##### Strategy

Two music streaming tiers: Spotify Free ( a lot advertisements) and Spotify Premium ( paid, remove advertisements, improve audio quality, download available), this is called 'freemium pricing strategy'.
Spotify pays artists based on their 'market share' (the number of streams for their songs as a proportion of total songs streamed on the service). They distribute approximately 70% to rights-holders.
Other competitors in the market like Grooveshark have been shut down as part of legal settlements, because strategies that did not compensate the music production, Spotify even having some artist criticism, has manage to hold some balance between their activities and the music production industry.
Spotify build open and active coalitions among business partners, creating structured channels aiming to ease the use of playlist on many business branches like media, festivals, not-for-profit organisations, audio hardware companies. They also facilitate partnerships at strategic openings for example fitness partners and gift card retailers. 

##### Structure

Spotify headquarters resides in London and its handles, research and development departments are in Stockholm.
Like many other matrix management organizations, Spotify subdivides the work among people with similar skills, and they are pooled for work assignments, resulting in more than one manager with their own responsibilities and competencies. All this managers are from that point, reporting hierarchical button up to the CTO and finally to the CEO.
Further literature does not specify aspect like functional elements (e.g., sales, service, R&D), and how they interact with eachother.

##### Systems

How things get done? 
according to [12], Spotify has a culture based on agile principles, that went down to Scum at early years, but some of the scrum practices were getting on the way so they decided to make them optional. Perhaps because they value agile principles more than scrum practices.
All engineering happens in squads (preferably less than 8 members), they try to keep those squads loosely coupled and tightly aligned. I could not find the reasons why they use squads, but perhaps they do it to attempt to minimizing dependencies.
They like cross-pollination instead of 'standardization', in order to spread knowledge, trends and tools between squads. It does not break the principle of 'isolated missions' because cross-pollination is used to spread the uses of tools like github for example. When there is no standard for the use of tools they can lose consistency. Despite this literature indicates that Spotify culture stands for flexibility and they found a happy balance.
Their code is shared on an internal open source model. Again this can be an attempt to avoid dependencies.
Squads make small and frequent releases as a routine, which is enabled due to decoupling their services.
They use release trains and feature toggles aiming get things into production early and often.
They claim that their culture is based on the people, therefore the focus on motivation, community and trust rather than structure and control.
Product development is based on Lean. They release their new features to a small group of customers limiting the 'blast radius' of a possible fail and it allows them to conduct a lot of small experiments. They report that it produces a lot of waste but this can be seen from a Lean perspective. 
They have something called 'core metrics data'. The data is fed dynamically due to constant experimentation.

##### Staffing

Spotify claims to have a very clear definition of what and how employees careers should develop in order to achieve the most important organization goals.[6]"Everyone in *Spotify tech* should have a way to grow their careers and expand the impact of their -work no matter what role they play".
The Spotify technology career framework, consist on letting the employee transfer itself on as many roles and domain expertise as possible in order to gain experience and later evaluate their impact into the organization.
*On recognition and promotions* Spotify observes constantly the impact someone has at a wider scope, and they have a formal ways to promote their employees.
*On setting the step for a new employee* Spotify gives 6 months to all new employees to get involved with their role and the organization.
*On compensation* A formal promotion should lead to higher pay in a straightforward and transparent way.

##### Skills

What is the organization good at?
According to [17]:
Spotify has better social features than its rivals, with the ability to add friends and see their playlists and listening, as well as a built-in messaging system to ping music back and forth. Creating and sharing your own playlists is easy too.
Another strength is the system for following musicians' profiles and getting notifications when they have new music out. A recently introduced concerts feed shows you upcoming, nearby gigs by artists you have listened to, which is useful.
It has good support for devices beyond the desktop and mobile: it is available on Sony’s PlayStation 4, Sonos hi-fis and through Google’s Chromecast and Amazon’s Fire TV, while its mobile app plays nicely with Apple TV too.
Spotify’s free tier has audio advertising, but is missing offline listening and – on mobile – the ability to pick tracks on-demand, although you can play an artist’s catalogue on shuffle mode. Pay €9.99 a month, and you get full access (including offline), no ads, and a higher-quality streams option.
Where Spotify falls down is its family plan, which is more expensive than rivals. You can add up to four extra accounts for €4.99 each, but that means you’ll pay €29.95 a month for a family of five compared to Apple Music and Google Play’s €14.99 for six.
Besides all of these, there actually are a couple of easy things to say where Spotify is very good at, like Spotify seems to be good at keeping their organization dynamic, focusing on their community rather to an hierarchical structure.

##### Style

How do the leaders interact with subordinates and others in the organization?
According with [12] Spotify have an Agile engineering culture, which means they like servant leaders rather than process masters.
Autonomy that every member team has over their work has evolve to a high rate percentage of team members satisfaction and they keep investing in it. 
Autonomy also seems to keep high motivation levels [12 and 13], teams are fast, and their minimize de dependency from and to, other teams.
 
##### Shared Values

The vision of Spotify is to give people access to all the music they want all the time, in a completely legal manner. 
It is their mission to ensure a fair digital deal for artists.
Spotify's vision is providing music moments everywhere, launching in more markets globally so that any music fan can access that music wherever they are.
Spotify's mission is also keeping the organization a very nice place to work in.

#### External Environment
Despite the evident growing of Spotify, and their alignment with the music industry on matters as fair trades and artist compensations, at the begin of 2015, according to [22] "The financial results reveal that the 25% of Spotify users who pay for the service account for 91% of its income: the company made €982.9m from subscriptions in 2014 and €98.8m  from advertising. Of that overall €1.08bn of revenues, €882.5m was spent on royalties and distribution costs. Spotify’s average headcount increased from 958 in 2013 to 1,354 in 2014, with its personnel costs rising from €114m to €180.9m in that period." Which means Spotify struggles with keeping their business profitable.



## 2.2 Non-Software industry ##

### KLM
Note: Most of the information about the leadership comes from talks with my (Ger) father, who is a copilot for KLM. Therefore there are no official sources to cite and the leadership style is largely from a pilot's point of view. So different departments will likely have other styles of internal management.
##### Strategy
KLM's main strategy is to position itself as a luxury brand. In their advertisement they position flying as something
unique and beautiful, instead of focusing on the price of the tickets. Instead of nickle-and-diming their customers for drinks and food like many other airlines, they prefer to just include it in the ticket price. This gives a more luxurious and relaxed feeling during flights. Together with this they also aim for a very user friendly
atmosphere by focusing a great deal of attention to twitter and facebook customer service.

In order to establish a better market position, KLM is a member of an airline alliance: Skyteam. Through these alliances airlines expand their global network of destinations. Through this network the airlines can offer a better service to their customers, they can integrate the flights of their allied airlines (this is called codesharing). This helps customers in making it easier to book multi-legged trips, thereby creating a one-stop-shop for virtually any destination in the world. Furthermore, it is customary for alliances to share frequent flyer miles. Which makes customers more likely to choose for an ally of their regular airline when needing to select a different airline, as such creating a stronger binding to their customer.
It has to be noted that this is not a very uncommon strategy. According to the Skytrax (http://www.airlinequality.com/) rating (which is most likely not a very scientific measurement, but it is still a recognized industry benchmark) there is only one five-star airline not participating in an alliance: Hainan Airlines. Likewise, a majority (21 of 38) of the airlines that are rated with four stars are participating in an alliance.
##### Structure
As to be expected of a company with 32.000 employees, the structure is very classical and hierarchical.
The executive committe consists of 13 people [5], each responsible for their subdivison of KLM. This kind of structure is not the best for quick decision making, but it is good at managing very large companies. The main division is done by function. Every occupation is in their own subdivison. Within these divisions there can be further subdivisions as well, for example the pilots have subdivisions based on the type of aircraft that they are flying. For such a global company you would expect that there is a more geographical structure. But pretty much every flight is either from or to Amsterdam or a layover of one of those flights. This means that most of the employees are living in the Netherlands. Of course there are always some exceptions, for example KLM has Asia based flight attendants to help reduce the language barrier on all of their flights to and from asian destinations.
##### Systems
The advantage of hierarchical systems is that it is usually very easy to identify the chain of command. Within the airplane everyone answers to the Captain and after that to the second in command. Who again answer to the chief of staff for the type of airplane they are flying. Due to the large amount of pilots (2.600) they rarely see the chief of staff though.  The advantage of this is, that it is easy to get things done, when on a trip the Captain is in charge of all decisions and only when something goes seriously wrong, they have to answer to their manager.

As for the actual performance of the job, airlines are surrounded by rules and regulations so most of what they do is done according to strict rulebooks and guidelines. For the customer, this means that they usually have a very consistant experience when flying aboard airplanes.
##### Staffing
A main pro of being a company this big and well known, with a prestigous brand name is that it is not very hard to get the right staff. People know how to find KLM, and this shows. They usually have no open vacancies for aircraft crew. Most open vacancies are usually in the IT field.
##### Skills
As noted before, a main skill of KLM is customer engagement through Twitter and Facebook, this helps in creating a very friendly brand name. Other skills of note are the international networking and cooperation through the Skyteam network, ensuring that you can reach virtually any destination of the world while flying with KLM or one of their partners.
##### Style
KLM's leadership style is very detached from the 'workfloor'. Captains all have their own style of leadership in their airplane. The main way of influence from higher management is through flight plans and regulations. But as stated earlier, pilots really only see their supervisor once something goes really wrong. So if a captain flies slightly faster than planned, which burns more fuel, to be on their destination earlier that will likely not attract any attention at all.  This means that the area in which leadership has the most influence is in all the supporting acitivities: routes, staff planning, catering, hotels, management, cargo and training.
##### Shared Values
The two Shared Values that KLM hold closest to its heart are: the experience of flying and customer service. In their commercials KLM emphasize the first shared value. In their actions on social media and training of flight crew they pay a great deal of attention to the second shared value`

#### External Environment
Since the economical crisis, airlines have had to deal with a smaller market for their services. A lot of companies chose the budget airline approach. In this approach airline travel is reduced to the bare minimum in order to reduce operating costs and ticket prices. For every extra that you need (food, luggage, etc.) you need to pay a premium. Due to this, companies that didn't change their approach are now the more luxurious companies. KLM is one of these. As stated before, KLM differentiates itself from other airlinse by offering great customer service through social media. As such KLM hopes to be ahead of its competitors by creating a better customer engagement.

## 2.3 Failed Case : HealthCare.gov ##

##### Background HealthCare.gov

In the previous sections we've analyzed two successful companies, through the eyes of the 7S model. Both very different organizations with very different perspectives and very different visions and missions. During our previous research we've analyzed the case of HealthCare.gov. This website is an integral part of the health care system of the United States. President Obama introduced the 'Obamacare'. The HealthCare.gov website must make sure that all American individuals can find and compare health insurance policies via one website. The system was launched on 01 October 2013. It is still live and in that sense it is not a failed case. However, based on our previous study and our analysis we can conclude that the development and organization of the system has been a failure. The original estimation for the costs of the project was $292 million. Before the launch the costs were already $500 million. According to figures from February 2014 the costs exceeded $1.7 billion by then [21]. Besides the tremendous costs, the launch of the system was surrounded by technical problems. In this section we analyze the case of HealthCare.gov further, by taking a careful look at the practices from successful companies. Despite the big differences between the industry and political organizations, there are organizational practices that can be shared. We want to know what the contractors behind HealthCare.gov could have learned from the practices of Spotify and KLM.

Comparing different companies is always a big challenge. Especially when they are in entirely different industries, this is difficult. It *seems* easier to talk about differences between companies, as companies have different products, a different vision and so on. This also is not the case when we look further then the superficial parts. We then have to take a deeper look at their processes and somehow make a rational comparison. It is required to take a step, or multiple steps, back and look very carefully at the business processes. Are they really that different from each other? Most of the time different outcomes are produced, but from an abstract perspective, similar tasks and procedures are followed. In this section we'll try to make this abstraction. We try to make a comparison and elaborate on whether we think HealthCare.gov could have succeeded when certain practices were applied.

Trying to compare processes between a company like Spotify with the processes within an initiative like HealthCare.gov seems like a futile task at first. Spotify is one company, producing a popular, but limited range of products. What would be the company with whom we compare? Should it be the client, thus the US government? Should it be CGI Federal Inc, one of the 55 (sub)contractors that were responsible for building HealthCare.gov? As our goal is to compare specific (sub)processes, we've decided not to compare at a company level. This would result in skewed findings, due to the very different worlds they live in. In order to make a more useful analysis, we focus on a couple of very specific aspects that we can compare. The 7S model provides us with some guidelines to start our comparison. With regard to HealthCare.gov, we have to form some hypotheses.

##### Dealing with knowledge creation & sharing

One of the many challenges for CGI at HealthCare.gov, was managing the amount of (sub)contractors. In total 55 contractors were involved. One of the biggest problems we see when multiple companies are involved, is that there are differences between companies in their perception of quality, success and many other factors. The project was already a challenge from a technical perspective (but not impossible according to our analysis), the real problems are in the project management area. Especially in the area of knowledge creation and sharing. From CMS, the designated systems integrator, we may expect that it is able to work in large collaborations. For other companies this is not a standard operation. These companies are working, more or less, in isolated bubbles and are not (or less) aware of what happens in the outside world. Because of the enormous scale, the biggest challenge was the project management organization. How was knowledge shared between the contractors? More precisely, how did project management make sure that the correct amount of specific knowledge was shared between contractors?

##### Knowledge creation & sharing at Spotify

Spotify is an interesting organization. It grew from 0 to 1800 employees in a period of approximately 10 years. From the total workforce there are approximately 700 employees with a technical profession. This increase of the workforce causes 'growing pains'. In a very small organization communication is still easy, the communication lines are short and everybody knows what everybody is doing. The bigger the company becomes, the more difficult it is to keep an overview. Dividing the work becomes a challenge, sharing knowledge with *everybody* becomes almost impossible. With hundreds of developers, how is it possible to communicate throughout the organization, without overloading the employees with information? How to keep learning from the experiences of the separate teams? And what is the important lesson here for HealthCare.gov?

One thing that Spotify kept in mind, was that they wanted to keep an agile mindset. With their growth, new working structures needed to be developed [3, page 1]. As explained before, the *Squad* is the basic unit. This unit can be compared to a Scrum team. The benefit of this, is that they are self-organizing. It has all the competencies on board that is necessary to fulfill a certain task. The Squad has a Product Owner (PO). The PO is responsible for prioritizing tasks. Furthermore we have an Agile Coach (AC). The AC is responsible to improve the way of working. Next, we have a *Tribe*. A Tribe exists out of a collection of Squads. These work together on particular system functionality. The Tribe has a Tribe Lead (TL), which is responsible for creating a good habitat for the Squads. By keeping the Tribes relatively small (less then 100 employees), it is still possible to limit the amount of *waste*. It is the intention of Spotify, to keep Squads as autonomous as possible. This is a problem when multiple Squads are involved in a certain feature. Thus, dependencies occur. Via surveys and meetings Spotify tries to identify these dependencies in an early stage. This way, they can find better ways to prioritize and deal with activities that compass multiple Squads or even Tribes.

The problem with this working structure is scale. Because of the (relative) autonomous Squads and Tribes, it can happen that reusable knowledge is not shared. One of the structures to prevent this, is a *Chapter*. People with similar skills, that work in similar competence areas, are part of a Chapter. A Chapter has a Chapter Lead (CL), that is responsible for people development. The final structure is a *Guild* and it is referred to as a 'community of interest'. It cuts through the organization and can encompass more than the other structures. It is a way to share knowledge throughout the organization. 

##### Knowledge sharing at KLM

What we've learned from KLM, is that they work together with other airlines in an alliance, the so called 'Skyteam'. The purpose of this setup is to improve their market position, by providing the customer with a better flying experience. The problem that airlines were facing, was that certain knowledge about customers was not shared. Also, services were not shared. This was problematic for the customers, because they've suffered from the problems of coordination between airlines. As explained earlier, these allied airlines solved this by sharing for example flight information. Better, this information is integrated, to help customers with transparently arranging their flights. Also other pieces of customer information are shared. The big benefit for the connected airlines is that they enforce a stronger customer binding.

This 'alliance' and 'sharing' culture, could have been a key factor in making this project work. Of course this situation is not completely comparable with HealthCare.gov. After all, the airlines are seeking a structural solution, where HealthCare.gov was one assignment. The many separate investigations of HealthCare.gov all indicated that none of the involved companies had an overview of what was going on. Although this is a management issue in the end, knowledge creation/sharing is a very important aspect. The complexity of the project can't be used as an excuse for this failure. It would have been a good thing, if the contractors approached this project as one entity. 

##### Dealing with complex projects at Heerema Marine Contractors

Another example, of how these alliances can work, is Heerema Marine Contractors (HMC), a Dutch offshore company that performs complicated projects for the oil & gas industry. Examples are transporting, installation and removing offshore facilities. But also installing subsea pipelines and infrastructures in ultra deep water. The market has forced HMC to think about how they work. Years ago, it was common that all these contractors worked separately at very specific tasks. In the present, the big oil companies tender for much larger projects. This concerns highly complex projects, for example EPCI (Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Installation) projects. The stakes and risks of these projects are incredibly high. HMC realized that they could not do projects on this scale alone. In order to cope with the changing market, HMC decided to join forces with Technip, a large French company with a big engineering capacity. Together they've formed a consortium and they offer their skills on specific projects as one entity. In this alliance, both companies profit from a stronger position in the market. The awarded Kaombo Project by Total E&P Angola, the largest subsea contract ever, is a direct result from this strategy.

##### What can we learn from the successful companies

The interesting question is, whether such a strategy would have made a difference for HealthCare.gov. In an earlier stage of the project, McKinsey already identified risks and root cause drivers [18]. One of these drivers was that there were no clear roles, responsibilities and processes for making change. The fact is, that HealthCare.gov was the most complex website for the government, ever. This was known upfront. What is not clear from the reports, is what the strategy concerning working together was. PMBOK was used as an indicative standard [14, page 5]. But 'indicative' provides too much freedom for a project of this scale. If we take back a step from all the separate findings, we can conclude one thing with certainty. Information was not (properly) shared between contractors and stakeholders. Interviewed employees pointed their finger at other contractors (which is a common action, when things go wrong), for not delivering in time. According to a report contractors were writing a lot of code themselves, where existing code should have been reused [15, page 11]. 

These are only a few of the alarming signals. If the government and CGI knew that this project was of this magnitude of complexity, they've should have taken action in their general strategy. It is very strange for a project like this, that it suffered from 'unclear responsibilities'. This kind of issue could have been prevented by working together as an alliance. In this form, it is not a matter of 'us' and 'they'. The purpose of an alliance, is that it becomes 'we'. That is a subtle, but fundamental difference in perception. It is not realistic that all 55 companies worked in 1 alliance for this case. What *could* have worked, was an alliance of the top-5 companies. There was already a huge, complex organization in the form of the government. At the other side of the table, there were all kinds of loosely connected managing boards of the contractors. The complexity of the organizational structure could have been lowered by having one board of directors at the contractor side. This should have been one entity, with very clear responsibilities. By forming an alliance, the companies could have improved their mutual communication lines a lot, although there is no guarantee that the total performance would have improved. Most alliances are formed with value creation and improvement of long term performance in mind. 

##### Developing shared knowledge processes and shared responsibility

The knowledge creation and sharing is not automatically enforced by forming an alliance. A problem with the amount of contractors was that the responsibility for the end product was not shared among all companies. An alliance would have forced the affiliated companies to create a shared vision. This alone could already make the development of a 'we' mentality possible. If the boards are forced to strategically collaborate and share their information, it is more likely that the work forces do the same. The shared responsibility also would have forced the companies to develop knowledge sharing systems. For example, HMC does this by sharing information via Microsoft Sharepoint systems. Numerous lessons from the project management and Document Control practices have been adopted in these systems.
The way how knowledge is shared between multiple parties is really valued by contractors and clients (BP referred to a 'world class' system). The main message is not that CGI should have used a Sharepoint system, but that the knowledge 'culture' should have been better. We've provided one example of how they could have done that (by forming one or more logical alliances). In the end, the project relied too heavily on contractors and third parties [14, page 6]. We believe that this problem could have been less if a shared vision was in place and if responsibilities were shared. Due to the magnitude of this project, it would have been necessary to do this in a more formal form. Otherwise contractors would have had an easy way out again.

##### Evaluation

[abstract lessons learned, place them in context]

## 2.4 RUP ##
### **What can we learn from this about RUP?**
##### Spotify
Spotify find as a challenge to handle big projects, they consider it a big source of waste since big projects demands a lot of squad to work tightly coordinated. They handle it until recently, visualizing progress with boards, daily sync meetings and weekly demos in order to interact fast with stakeholders. For all cases they acknowledge that there is a lot to discover on that field. Perhaps a RUP approach which promote first risk management would **learn** Spotify to estimate the risk and the cost benefit of incurring in such big projects.

##### KLM
Our insights on KLM do not help in dealing with RUP. RUP is focused on products in changing environments. For example, one of the key components in RUP is requirement management, since these are often changed during the project. KLM does not have this problem, customers buy a ticket and get their transportation to their destination. Every part of the job is done according to strict guidelines and rulebooks, software development is more of a creative job where you do not know how things will go at the start of the project.
## 2.5 Scrum ##

### **What can we learn from this about Scrum?**
##### Spotify
At the beginning Spotify was a scrum company. As we know scrum is a well established Agile development approach, scrum gave the foundations to the team-oriented culture. After some years, some of the scrum practices were getting on the way, for example 'spring planning meetings', 'burndown charts', 'estimation', so they decided to make it optional or "on demand" or even mix with other development approaches.
**We can learn that rules can be a good start, but breaking a rule when is needed can be also a good practice.**
##### KLM
Since scrum is more focused on the team than on the product, a comparison with the KLM flight crew can be made.
The crew aboard an aircraft is not that different from a scrum team. Both teams are self sufficient in the sense that they have everything that they need to get the job done. One of the lessons that could be taken from KLM is that it is perhaps not needed to have a scrum team consist only out of peers. It could perhaps relieve some pressure if there was one 'captain' in a scrum team. Someone who gets the final say over anything the team does, in case there is a dispute about something. This could mean that there is less time spent in meetings, and more doing actual programming. Note that this is different from a product owner. The product owner gets to decide what the team does, and the captain would have the final say in how to do it. A  drawback would be the loss of control for individuals. This may reduce motivation and as such could also lead to a drop in productivity instead of increasing it.
