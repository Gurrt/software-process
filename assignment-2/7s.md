#7S Framework.

## 1. Introduction.
7S is a management model developed by  R.H. Waterman Jr. and T.Peters. The 7 Ss are structure, strategy, systems, skills, style, staff and shared values. The model is most often used as an organizational analysis tool to assess and monitor changes in the internal situation of an organization
* *Principals* .- (think about measures that will improve performance).
One of the most remarcable principals is that these seven elements need to be aligned and helping each other in order to hold performance at the host organization, and organizations must be align with external enviroment. 
The model can help to identify non aligned issues at critical moments like during changes at the organization. Also to clarify some of the key issues that must be addressed for such organizations to be effective and adaptive.

* *Objectives* .- **Strategy** : What makes the organization special?. Ones such question is answer of course based on the organization vison statement. The next step is to identify the kind of problems the organization addresses on its functional areas, aiming to enhance its competitive advantage. **Structure**: How the organization is arranged or configured? For example some organizations are divided for their geographical distribution, others for its functionalities, others focussed on their main production, aiming to clarify its integration and coordination mechanisms.
**Systems**:  It refers to the formal procedures for measurement, rules and processes for getting things done and managing the activity of the organization. They include personnel evaluation , rewards, performance assessments, chain-ofcommand relationships, policies for planning, monitoring, and executing projects.
**Staffing**: It refers to organization's human resources and how they are recruited, selected, and trained to perform their jobs, aiming to choose what is best for its demographic, educational and attitudinal characteristics.
**Skills**:  What is the organization good at, and what special skills and competencies are found its people, and at the organization itself?. Aiming to identify organization's core competencies and distinctive capabilities.
**Style**: How do the leaders interface with subordinates and others in the organization, and how do members interact with each other?. Aiming to identify typical behavior patterns of key groups.

### KLM
##### Strategy
KLM's main strategy is to position itself as a luxury brand. In their advertisement they position flying as something
unique and beautiful, instead of focusing on the price of the tickets. Instead of nickle-and-diming their customers for drinks and food like many other airlines, they prefer to just include it in the ticket price. This gives a more luxurious and relaxed feeling during flights. Together with this they also aim for a very user friendly
atmosphere by focusing a great deal of attention to twitter and facebook customer service.
##### Structure
As to be expected of a 32.000 employee company, the structure is very classical and hierarchical.
The executive committe consists out of 13 people, each responsible for their subdivison of KLM. This kind of structure is not the best for quick decision making, but it is good at managing very large companies. And tons of independent scrum teams consisting out of all the personnel needed to maintain, supply, staff and fly a plane would most likely become a big mess. Companies like this need big planning departments and overarching management to make decisions on what course of action to take.
##### Systems
The advantage of hierarchical systems is that it is usually very easy to identify the chain of command. Within the airplane everyone answers to the Captain. Who again answers to the COO, which seen the hierarchical structure of the company is probably not directly but through an operations manager or someone in a similar function. The advantage of this is, that it is easy to get things done, when on a trip the Captain is in charge of all decisions and only has to report to his supervisor afterwards.
##### Staffing
A main pro of being a company this big and well known, with a prestigous brand name is that it is not very hard to get the right staff. People know how to find KLM, and this shows. They usually have no open vacancies for aircraft crew. Most open vacancies are usually in the IT field.
