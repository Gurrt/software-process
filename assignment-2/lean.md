#Lean

The LEAN methodology, also known as a Toyota Production System, it is engineering methodology which has its origin in the production method that Toyota used to produce its cars. The methodology has spread to other areas and many companies replicate the process trying to achieve the same success that Toyota had, although so far none has been as successful as Toyota.

The methodology aims to eliminate the overburden (muri), inconsistency (mura) and overwaste (muda).

[Explanation of the system: JIT, PULL, etc]

[Expand muda concept]

RUP generates more waste:
- Design phases do not produce anything.
- Iterations have an overhead cost.
- All the documents produced which are not the real product.

Scrum generates more waste:
- Same project may require various teams, with the management overhead (various PO, SMâ€¦)
- Iterations produce not completed products, which are not what the client request.
- Constant changes may lead to reimplement features (weak argument, need to rethink).
