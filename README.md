# software-process

## Organization
Our team consists out the following eight members:
Alex van Manen (Lead),
Pim Tegelaar (Vice Lead),
Job Witteman,
Erik Verhoofstad,
Alberto Martinez de Murga,
Ger Krijnen,
Carla Alvarado &
Joel James Bartholomew

Every team member is responsibility of doing some work that he or she chooses. Instead of assigning tasks. People will take a task from the Scrum Board and work on that task. When they are done they will put it in the next state and some one else will verify it and they go on to do their next task.


### Grading Requirements
Alex, with his teaching experience, will make a grading scheme which will form the guideline to our self grading.
From this scheme we can then elicit the requirements for a good grade and keep them in mind during our writing sessions.

### Mechanism for frame of reference
We're basing our process on a [scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)-like way of working.
We're using only the core of scrum, which is the [scrum-board](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/task-boards) hosted on [trello](https://trello.com).

### Work break-down
We're breaking up the work by converting all sub-assignments in the blackboard document into tickets on our scrum board, further dividing them up in smaller tasks as needed.

### Quality and progress assurance
We all agreed to taking up at least one ticket and completing it during the week to control progress.
Furthermore, we also scheduled two Skype sessions (thursday, saturday) to monitor the progress of the assignment.
If progress and/or quality are lacking, we can decide upon a further course of action during one of those sessions. We have a verify column on our trello scrum board. Every task that is executed is being verified by another team member.

### Individual contribution monitoring
This is the reason that we've chosen [github](https://github.com) to host our assignments.
On github we can use the commit log to see what each member contributed.
Moreover, Github is also used to peer review the text that will be added to the master branch through pull requests.

### Support
Github also has a nice issue tracking system, we're using this to ask eachother for help and/or suggest improvements to text.

### Portal
These are links to the tools that we use to enabling us to work and communicate.

### Reflection
We schedule a weekly time-boxed session in which we evaluate and adjust our process based on the individual input of the group members. This session is based on the retrospective meeting from scrum.
