### Assignment - Report 

##e. Analysis for failure.
Because CMS did not always provide adequate contract management and oversight for Federal marketplace contracts, (1) contractor delays and performance issues were not always identified, (2) a contractor incurred unauthorized costs that increased the cost of the contract, (3) contracting officers in all Government agencies did not have access to contractor pastperformance evaluations when making contract awards, and (4) critical deliverables and management decisions were not properly documented.
