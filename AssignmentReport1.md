###What is healthcare.gov?
>a. Summarise the project: what, who, when, how


Healthcare.gov is a IT-system that was commissioned by the US federal government to support the legislation of the Afforable Care Act (ACA) or informaly as Obamacare. Healthcare.gov is an electronic health insurance marketplace for US residents who do not have health insurance coverage by other means like Medicair. Every state in the US could choose if they would use healthcare.gov or if they would create the own online health insurance marketplace. Originally the residents of 36 states would use healthcare.gov. Currently the website serves 44 states according to the Government Accountability Office [5].

###Project management
The following answers should be answered:


>b. Identify the complexity of the project as was understood at the start of the project;

>c. describe and analyse how the project organization was set up to develop a good solution


The construction of healthcare.gov was overseen by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which is a part of the US Department of Healt and Human Services (HHS). Th



 55 different contractors, all-operating under the supervision of the ......)

### Reasons for failure & actions taken

>d. Identify the reasons for failure, see when these became apparent and what was done to mitigate these problems

During its launch (1 October 2013) the website did not perform well. Only 271,000 of the 9.47 million users that try to registrate where succesfull. ?There was already $700 million dollar spend? In 2014 the total number of costs of the project is 1.7 billion dollar (reference).



###Analysis for failure.
>e. Provide the analysis for the failure as presented by the evaluation reports you

The failure was caused by a complex interplay of problems:

##### Managing Contractors:
 6. Contractor delays and performance issues were not always identified.
 7. A contractor incurred unauthorized costs that increased the cost of the contract.
 8. Contracting officers in all Government agencies did not have access to contractor past-performance evaluations when making contract awards.
 9. Critical deliverables and management decisions were not properly documented.


##### Architecture: non functional requirements.
 1.  The system was not designed to handle the massive influx of initial users. 
 2.  Insufficient effort made to build a system that would meet the performance and availability needs of it's stakeholders. 
 3.  Security solutions were seemingly slapped together in a shoddy manner instead of through the kind of systematic approach that is expected in a highquality software solution.
 4. Many thousands of pages of legal healthcare regulations did not translated seamlessly into functional requirements.
 5. The basic architecture was designed and built around the notion that the system would forward requests for quotes from insurance seekers to external vendors in real-time; however, this massive interconnectivity and the subsequent burden on the government servers caused the system to collapse

 
##### Change Managment: Warnings couldn't be taking in consideration.
