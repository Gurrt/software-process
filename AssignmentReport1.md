### Assignment - Report 

####e. Analysis for failure.

The failure was caused by a complex interplay of problems:

#### Managing Contractors:
Because CMS did not always provide adequate contract management and oversight for Federal marketplace contracts.
1. Contractor delays and performance issues were not always identified.
2. A contractor incurred unauthorized costs that increased the cost of the contract.
3. Contracting officers in all Government agencies did not have access to contractor pastperformance evaluations when making contract awards.
4. Critical deliverables and management decisions were not properly documented. 

#### Architecture: non functional requirements.
 1.  The system simply was not designed to handle the massive infl ux of initial users. 
 2.  Insufficient effort made to build a system that would meet the performance and availability needs of its stakeholders. 
 3.  Security solutions were seemingly slapped together in a shoddy manner instead of through the kind of systematic approach that is expected in a highquality software solution.
 4. Many thousands of pages of legal healthcare regulations did not translated seamlessly into functional requirements.
 5. The basic architecture was designed and built around the notion that the system would forward requests for quotes from insurance seekers to external vendors in real-time; however, this massive interconnectivity and the subsequent burden on the government servers caused the system to collapse
 
#### Change Managment: Warnings couldn't be taking in consideration.
