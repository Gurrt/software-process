02-02-2016 Workshop notes
=========================

Hans was apparently not happy with the proposed plan he received.

It may be difficult to find information on the healthcare.gov project relating to its software process.

He suggested appointing a product owner for the project.

Not everyone needs to be directly involved in the writing of the document.

He strongly suggested that the final document have 3-4 different parts and that each part have its own product owner.

The different parts should be based on our own insights and how the different principles of the development methodologies could improve the process.

He also said it was important to have peer review ensure that everyone is contributing to the project.

It does not really matter to Hans if we were to turn in one document with all the work in it or multiple documents.

Edit By Ger:
He also said that we're free to keep the structure as it is right now, and see how it works for us. He strongly suggested we have a product owner for each of the three/four parts who does all the writing. And a few man to support him by doing the research work.
If we want to have a nice grade we should go in depth about one part of the project, Hans suggested Executable Architecture, and find some nice comparisons with succesful projects.
