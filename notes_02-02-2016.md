02-02-2016 Workshop notes
=========================

Hans was apparently not happy with the proposed plan he received.

It may be difficult to find information on the healthcare.gov project relating to its software process.

He suggested appointing a product owner for the project.

Not everyone needs to be directly involved in the writing of the document.

He strongly suggested that the final document have 3-4 different parts and that each part have its own product owner.

The different parts should be based on our own insights and how the different principles of the development methodologies could improve the process.

He also said it was important to have peer review ensure that everyone is contributing to the project.

It does not really matter to Hans if we were to turn in one document with all the work in it or multiple documents.
