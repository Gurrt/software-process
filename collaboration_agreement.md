Collaboration Agreement
=======================

This document is a list of (potential) rules that everyone in the group agrees to follow. In the event that someone breaks a rule, the situation will be reported to the lecturer(Hans) and this may result in them leaving the group.

- One should notify the group members at least 1 day ahead of time if they are going to be absent for any of the scheduled meetings. If someone is absent 2 times without notifying anyone the situation will be escalated.

- One should notify the group if they are going to be late to any of the meetings. One person can be late a maximum of 3 times and only 1 time without telling the group that they are going to be late beforehand.

- Everyone in the group agrees to contribute. Action will be taken in the event that someone shows 2 times that they are not interested in contributing for example by failing to meet the deadlines they have agreed upon without providing the group any update on their status.
