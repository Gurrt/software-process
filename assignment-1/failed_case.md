#Healthcare.gov: 

### Failed case

Healthcare.gov is a IT-system that was commissioned by the US federal government to support the legislation of the Afforable Care Act (ACA) or informaly as Obamacare. Healthcare.gov is an electronic health insurance marketplace for US residents who do not have health insurance coverage by other means like Medicair. Every state in the US could choose if they would use healthcare.gov or if they would create the own online health insurance marketplace. Originally the residents of 36 states would use that healthcare.gov, but currently it serves 44 states (GAO, 2013).

The construction of healthcare.gov was overseen by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which is a part of the US Department of Healt and Human Services (HHS). Th

During its launch (1 October 2013) the website did not perform well. Only 271,000 of the 9.47 million users that try to registrate where succesfull. ?There was already $700 million dollar spend? In 2014 the total number of costs of the project is 1.7 billion dollar (reference).

Despite the strong political will and extensive spending, Healthcare.- gov crashed during its launch on October 1st, 2013 and remained inactive for several weeks. The website failed to meet initially grounded require- ments for providing its services and various glitches were reported for a period of time. The development of the Healthcare.gov website involved 55 different contractors, all-operating under the supervision of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within HHS. Project definition issues were shown following events that underestimated various requirements, such as to define a redundant ICT architecture, not being able to handle a massive number of individual users which attempted to register simultaneously immediately after pro- ject launch. There were 9.47 million users that attempted to register during the first week of the launch, and only 271,000 succeeded (Cleland-Huang, 2014).

E-government project failure factors.


Project Management issues: weak definitions of
requirements and scope.
It is recognized that technology problems and unexpectedly
heavy Internet traffic have been occurred.

Project Management issues: weak definitions of
requirements and scope; unsuccessful monitoring and
measurement.
ICT reasons and system development process
Careful requirements definition would resolve this problem.


Project Management issues: unsuccessful monitoring and
measurement
Sudden update demands reflect missing definitions and
inappropriate monitoring.
