# Failed Project - Healthcare.gov

## Abstract

On 23 March 2010 president Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. One of the consequences of this law was that everyone in the USA should have access to a health insurance marketplace. Therefore the federal government created a website called HealtCare.gov. The launch of the website was on 1 October 2013 and, but was from the beginning plagued by technical difficulties. The $630 million website crashes a couple of minutes after the launch. From the 9.47 million people that tried to sign up in the first few weeks only 271,000 succeeded in doing so. 

This paper focuses on why this big project (partially) failed and which software- and project methodology principles were not applied. This is being done by first explaining the project complexity, the project organization and identifying the reasons for the failure. After that this paper analysis the reasons for failure to come to the root causes of the failure and explains which principles from RUP, Scrum and the Marslander project were applied and which not.
