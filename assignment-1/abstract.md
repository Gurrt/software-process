# Failed Project - Healthcare.gov

## Abstract

On 23 March 2010, president Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. One of the consequences of this law was that everyone in the USA would require access to a health insurance marketplace. Therefore the federal government started the HealtCare.gov project. The launch of the website was on 1 October 2013, but from the beginning it has been plagued by technical difficulties. The $630 million website crashed a couple of minutes after the launch. From the 9.47 million people that tried to sign up in the first few weeks only 271,000 succeeded in doing so. 

This report focuses on why this big project (partially) failed and which software and project methodology principles were not applied. This is done by first explaining the project's complexity, its organization and identifying the reasons for the failure. After that, this report analyses the reasons to determine the root causes and explains which principles from RUP, Scrum and the Mars Lander project were applied and which not.
