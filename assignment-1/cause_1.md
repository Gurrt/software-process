# Contractor Management

## Key factors in failure

One of the most important reasons for the failure of the *Healthcare.gov*
project, from the process and management point of view, was a mismanagement of contractors.

The *Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services* (CMS) depended heavily on
contractors to develop and manage the *Federal marketplace*. Federal law
prescribes precise rules that contractor officers need to follow in order
to manage the performance of the contractors. The following mistakes were
made during the project [3]:

* **Contracting officers did not receive all
  contract deliverables and periodically neglected to use those to monitor the contractors
  performance.** Law enforces the contractor officers and their representatives
  to monitor the performance of their contractors. Sometimes report were incomplete
  and deliverables handed in months after their deadlines, without any explanation requested by or given to the CMS.

* **Unathorised CMS personnel added work and increased the cost of one of the
  contracts.** Contractor officers added extra work to onne contract without having the authority to issue such work, around 40 work units were added for a total extra cost of $28 million.

* **Contract officer's representatives were not properly designated and
  authorised in written contracts.** 75% of the contracts reviewed missed
  important information like the contracting officer's representative or the
  specific duties and responsibilites assigned for each contract.

* **CMS's contracting officer representatives didn't have the required certification.**
  Contracts that are valued at more than 10 million dollar require a Level III certifcation in risk management.
  Not all contracting officer's representatives, who worked with contracts of this size possesed the required certification.

* **CMS has not complied with the standards of ethical conduct in atleast one occasion.** In one case, one of the CMS panel members responsible for        awarding a contract had recently worked together with the party that applied for the contract, thus creating a possible conflict of   interests. The employee didn't raise this as an issue to his supervisor(s) and as such acted in an unethical way.
 
* **Contracting officers did not always prepare contractor past-performance
  evaluations**. Some contracts were not registered at the instituion that keeps
  a record of government contractors. And subsequently, the CMS didn't perform
  performance reviews for those contracts that are required for the logs of that institution.

## Scrum

### Principles applied during the project

Part of the Scrum methodology is to prioritise communication over documentation.
Due to the all the legal requirements and licensing required for the project,
Scrum methodologies were not applied during the contractor management as they
are totally opposed to the requirements needed. Contractors claimed to use
agile methodologies during the development but we do not have further details
about those claims.

### Which principles could help healthcare.gov

Scrum is a methodology which is effective in small groups of developers. Due to
the size of the project, a pure Scrum methodology would have not been
appropiated. However, some of the problems cited before related with the
management would have been solved using certain techniques related with Scrum.

As one of the problems was the addition of task to the original contracts,
a well rounded up and closed **product backlog** would have solved the problem
of the increase of the work units. Referred to the unauthorised personnel
adding those work units, the presence of a **product owner** as intermediary of
any modification would have avoid any unauthorised person could have modified
the work units.

The rest of the problems associated with management were related with the lack
of deliverables, certifications and reports. Due to the preference of no
documents of Scrum and other agile projects, they would not have been able to
help the project in this aspect as the problem is it out of their scope.

## RUP

### Principles applied during the project

* Vision: The vision of what to build was clear, thousands of pages of legal
  documents provided documentation on what to build exactly.[1]

* Plan: The product was planned to launch on 1 October 2015 and did so. Testing
  was planned for two weeks before launch [2]. The plan might not have been
  ideal, but it was there.

* Risks: Laws on contracting dictate what has to be done to supervisor
  contractors to mitigate risks, however those laws were not always followed
  [3]. This means that this principle was not followed correctly.

* Issues: Due to a lack of data, it is hard to tell what has been done in order
  to track issues.

* Architecture: While there was an architecture set to integrate all the
  services, it wasn't designed to handle to load that it got on the launch
  day.[4]

* Product: This step focuses mainly on building the product step by step and
  testing it during every step. In some cases this was done, with the front-end
  for example. The front-end was made by [Development
  Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and the non-interactive part of this went
  live before the rest of healthcare.gov. This part of the healthcare.gov
  website was generally well received and appreciated for its modern take on
  government websites.(CITATION NEEDED). While the system as a whole was only
  tested two weeks before launch. Which was too short to find all important
  bugs, and too close to launch to fix all the problems that were found.

* Evaluation: This principle assumes an interative approach, which was not
  present during the building of healthcare.gov. So this principle was not
  followed at all.
* Change Requests: Sources state that the Obama administration often changed
  the requirements. (CITATION NEEDED) Which probably has caused some hardship
  with the changes trickling down to all the contractors, but there is a lack
  of documentation on how the changes were documented and implemented.

### Which principles could help healthcare.gov

As stated above, a stricter monitoring of the deliverables by the contractors
couldhave helped this project. What also could have prevented the failure was
a better focus on product and evaluation. If a more Agile way of working was
promoted, with small deliverables, that can be tested. Then perhaps bugs and
the wrong scale for the architecture could have been identified earlier,
while there was still time to fix the problems. Instead of when the integration
happened, two weeks before the launch.
