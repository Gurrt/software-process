# Contractor Management

## Scrum

## RUP

### Principles applied during the project
 * Vision: The vision of what to build was clear, thousands of pages of legal documents provided documentation on what to build exactly.[1]
 * Plan: The product was planned to launch on 1 October 2015 and did so. Testing was planned for two weeks before launch [2]. The plan might not have been ideal, but it was there.
 * Risks: Laws on contracting dictate what has to be done to supervisor contractors to mitigate risks, however those laws weren't always followed [3]. This means that this principle wasn't followed correctly.
 * Issues: Due to a lack of data, it is hard to tell what has been done in order to track issues.
 * Business Case: Not Applicable, this project was mandated by law and therefore needs no business case.
 * Architecture: While there was an architecture set to integrate all the services, it wasn't designed to handle to load that it got on the launch day.[4]
 * Product: This step focuses mainly on building the product step by step and testing it during every step. In some cases this was done, with the front-end for example.
  The front-end was made by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and the non-interactive part of this went live before the rest of healthcare.gov.
  This part of the healthcare.gov website was generally well received and appreciated for its modern take on government websites.(CITATION NEEDED).
  While the system as a whole was only tested two weeks before launch. Which was too short to find all important bugs, and too close to launch to fix all the problems that were found.
  * Evaluation: This principle assumes an interative approach, which wasn't present during the building of healthcare.gov. So this principle was not followed at all.
  * Change Requests: Sources state that the Obama administration often changed the requirements. (CITATION NEEDED) But there is a lack of documentation on how the changes were documented and implemented.
  * User Support: Not Applicable to this section of the report.
