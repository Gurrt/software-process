# Contractor Management

## Scrum

## RUP

### Principles applied during the project
 
* Vision: The vision of what to build was clear, thousands of pages of legal documents provided documentation on what to build exactly.[1]

 * Plan: The product was planned to launch on 1 October 2015 and did so. Testing was planned for two weeks before launch [2]. The plan might not have been ideal, but it was there.
 
* Risks: Laws on contracting dictate what has to be done to supervisor contractors to mitigate risks, however those laws were not always followed [3]. This means that this principle was not followed correctly.

 * Issues: Due to a lack of data, it is hard to tell what has been done in order to track issues.

 * Architecture: While there was an architecture set to integrate all the services, it wasn't designed to handle to load that it got on the launch day.[4]

* Product: This step focuses mainly on building the product step by step and testing it during every step. In some cases this was done, with the front-end for example.
  The front-end was made by [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and the non-interactive part of this went live before the rest of healthcare.gov.
  This part of the healthcare.gov website was generally well received and appreciated for its modern take on government websites.(CITATION NEEDED).
  While the system as a whole was only tested two weeks before launch. Which was too short to find all important bugs, and too close to launch to fix all the problems that were found.

* Evaluation: This principle assumes an interative approach, which was not present during the building of healthcare.gov. So this principle was not followed at all.
* Change Requests: Sources state that the Obama administration often changed the requirements. (CITATION NEEDED) Which probably has caused some hardship with the changes trickling down to all the contractors, but there is a lack of documentation on how the changes were documented and implemented.
 
### Key factors in failure
The most important key factor in the contractor management problem was the **risks** factor.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was by law required to overssee the performance and in some cases did not.
CGI Federal, the main contractor for the healthcare.gov website, was supposed to deliver a plan which "provides a systematic and structured process for the Government to
evaluate the services the contractor will provide, including but not limited to processes,
methods, metrics, customer satisfaction surveys, service-level agreements, and
operational level agreements.".[3] The contractor's status reports shows that they delivered this plan 2 months late, but the CMS said that they never received it.
This means that for their biggest contractor on the project, the CMS had no way of verifying the progress.

### Which principles could help healthcare.gov
As stated above, a stricter monitoring of the deliverables by the contractors could have helped this project.
What also could have prevented the failure was a better focus on product and evaluation. If a more Agile way of working was promoted, with small deliverables, that can be tested.
Then perhaps bugs and the wrong scale for the architecture could have been identified earlier, while there was still time to fix the problems. Instead of when the integration happened, two weeks before the launch.
