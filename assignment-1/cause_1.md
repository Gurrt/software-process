# Contractor Management

## Key factors in failure

One of the most importants reasons for the failure of the *Healthcare.gov*
project from the process and management point of view were several
irregularities of the contractor management.

The *Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services* (CMS from now) depend heavily on
contractors to create and manage the *Federal marketplace*. The CMS commited
several irregularties arranging and managing their contractor officer and
contractor representatives that can be sumarised in the following points:

* **Contracting officers and their representatives did not received all
  contract deliverables and not always used them to monitor the contractors
  performance.** Law enforces the contractor officers and their representatives
  to monitor de performance of the contractors. These reports were incomplete
  with missing documentation and handled between several months to a few years
  later.

* **Unathorised CMS personnel added work and increased the cost of one of the
  contracts.** Contractor officers added extra work with its increased cost
  without the knowledge of the contractor representatives. Around 40 work units
  were added and they meant an overrun over $28 million.

* **Contract officers representatives were not properly designated and
  authorised in written contracts.** 75% of the contracts reviewed[3] missed
  important information like the contracting officer's representative or the
  specific duties and responsibilites assigned for each contract.

* **CMS delayed the implementation of the normative about certifications for
  contracting officer's representatives.** The new normative requires different
  levels of training and professional experience to attain and maintain
  different certifications levels, in this case, Level-III. Not all contracting
  officer's representatives who managed contracts over $10 millons dolars had
  the requested certification. Contracting officer's representatives alleged
  missunderstading of the normative while the CMS claimed to have their own
  certification process.

* **CMS may have not complied with the starndards of ethical conduct.** There
  were cases in which CMS and its employees may have been in a conflict of
  interest situation.

* **Contracting officers did not always prepared contractor past-performance
  evaluations**. During the review[3], several documents containing the record
  of all contractual actions were requested. Those documents were not provided
  by any of the parties while both should have kept track of them.

## Scrum

### Principles applied during the project

Part of Scrum methodology is to prioritise communication over documentation.
Due to the all the legal requirements and licensing required for the project,
Scum methodologies were not applied during the contractor management as they
are totally opposed to the requirements needed. Contractors claimed to use
agile methodologies during the development but we do not have further details
about those claims.

### Which principles could help healthcare.gov

Scrum is a methodology which is effective in small groups of developers. Due to
the size of the project, a pure Scrum methodology would have not been
appropiated. However, some of the problems cited before related with the
management would have been solved using certain techniques related with Scrum.

As one of the problems was the addition of task to the original contracts,
a well rounded up and closed **product backlog** would have solved the problem
of the increase of the work units. Referred to the unauthorised personnel
adding those work units, the presence of a **product owner** as intermediary of
any modification would have avoid any unauthorised person could have modified
the work units.

The rest of the problems associated with management were related with the lack
of deliverables, certifications and reports. Due to the preference of no
documents of Scrum and other agile projects, they would not have been able to
help the project in this aspect as the problem is it out of their scope.

## RUP

### Principles applied during the project

* Vision: The vision of what to build was clear, thousands of pages of legal
  documents provided documentation on what to build exactly.[1]

* Plan: The product was planned to launch on 1 October 2015 and did so. Testing
  was planned for two weeks before launch [2]. The plan might not have been
  ideal, but it was there.

* Risks: Laws on contracting dictate what has to be done to supervisor
  contractors to mitigate risks, however those laws were not always followed
  [3]. This means that this principle was not followed correctly.

* Issues: Due to a lack of data, it is hard to tell what has been done in order
  to track issues.

* Architecture: While there was an architecture set to integrate all the
  services, it wasn't designed to handle to load that it got on the launch
  day.[4]

* Product: This step focuses mainly on building the product step by step and
  testing it during every step. In some cases this was done, with the front-end
  for example. The front-end was made by [Development
  Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and the non-interactive part of this went
  live before the rest of healthcare.gov. This part of the healthcare.gov
  website was generally well received and appreciated for its modern take on
  government websites.(CITATION NEEDED). While the system as a whole was only
  tested two weeks before launch. Which was too short to find all important
  bugs, and too close to launch to fix all the problems that were found.

* Evaluation: This principle assumes an interative approach, which was not
  present during the building of healthcare.gov. So this principle was not
  followed at all.
* Change Requests: Sources state that the Obama administration often changed
  the requirements. (CITATION NEEDED) Which probably has caused some hardship
  with the changes trickling down to all the contractors, but there is a lack
  of documentation on how the changes were documented and implemented.

### Which principles could help healthcare.gov

As stated above, a stricter monitoring of the deliverables by the contractors
couldhave helped this project. What also could have prevented the failure was
a better focus on product and evaluation. If a more Agile way of working was
promoted, with small deliverables, that can be tested. Then perhaps bugs and
the wrong scale for the architecture could have been identified earlier,
while there was still time to fix the problems. Instead of when the integration
happened, two weeks before the launch.
