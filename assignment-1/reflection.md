#Ger
## The Good
- I believe that the majority of the team was very professional and quick to react to questions
- We adjusted well to the change in structure that was suggested by Hans.

## The Bad

- I feel that Markdown is a little too barebones for writing reports like these, I'd be happier using LaTeX.
- It is understandable that Job had to reserve some time for his Thesis Plan, but it is still unfortunate that it left Erik behind solo in their part of the Assignment. No hard feelings Job, we love you!

## The Ugly

- Alex had to call me on the Saturday morning before the deadline to tell me that we (Alberto and me) were missing the Mars Lander part that Alberto was supposed to write the night before. It got fixed in the end, but it was not a nice way to wake up.

# Joel 

It was a bit of a new experience for me to work on the assignment due to most of the part time students only being present on Mondays which means that the day is dedicated entirely to discussion. I tend to take a very passive role when it comes to discussion.

Assigning product owners resulted in smaller groups forming and this made it overall easier to work as there was less communication overhead. This is something that should be done for the next assignment. Especially when its not really possible for everyone to work in the same place.

I believe that the use of Markdown as our document writing format was fine for the most part but that maybe other options should be explored for the next assignment.

The Trello board that was setup did not get used as much. For the next assignment we should consider keeping it more up to date or perhaps use more traditional methods of task management.

Overall, I think everyone did their part to contribute and this assignment went by pretty well. 

#Erik
## The Good
- We quickly had a collaboration infrastructure in place for task management (Trello), scheduling (Google Calendar), conferencing (Whatsapp, Google Hangout) and version control for our documents. (Github)
- The team adjusted well to the feedback Hans gave us in the second week not afraid to turn into a new direction.
- The in week 2 scheduled milestones made the team more goal oriÃ«nted.

##The Bad and Ugly
- Almost nothing written by the team in the first week was used in the final document. This gives somewhat of a feeling that that time was ill spent.

# Alberto

## The Good
- Good communication, everyone was on point contributing to the project and people was willing to work.
- The team was able to respond to feedback quickly and adapt to the changes in the requirements.
- Everyone stuck to the fixed deadlines we established.

## The Bad
- The requirements and goals for the assignment were not clear at all. We had to guess and assume many things about the project.

## The Ugly
- As most of us are part timers, we had to rely a lot on whatsapp, hangouts and remote working.

#Alex
## The Good
- I like that most of the team members are motivated, good communication and respect the agreements that we have established together.
- I think Erik did a good job by doing the task of him and Job all by himself. Thumbs up for Erik.

## The Bad

- My opinion is that the contract on the blackboard was not clear. Maybe it's part of the learning process and we need to ask it to the lecturer. The result now was that we did not spend on the wrong deliverables the first week.

## The Ugly
- I'm not happy with the Alberto's performance this week. He was late at meetings. Did not keep the deadlines and let Ger do part of his work (I'm refering on the Mars Lander part and the rewriting of the Scrum part of the first root cause).

#Pim
##The Good
- We managed to make decisions and not get stuck in debate for a long time (which often happens in large groups).
- We made a quick start setting up infrastructure
- Even though we had the difficulty of having different schedules and locations, we made it work.
- Using markdown allowed us to focus on the content, rather than the layout in the beginning.

## The Bad
- We did not manage to create tasks that are relatively small, leading us to review only at the end of the assignment.
- In the beginning, there was no clear goal for meetings, making them chaotic.
- We had to change our plan half way through the assignment.

## The Ugly
- We started out enthusiastically using Trello, but left it to bleed to death after a few days.
