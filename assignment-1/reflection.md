## The Good
- I believe that the majority of the team was very professional and quick to react to questions
- We adjusted well to the change in structure that was suggested by Hans.

## The Bad

- I feel that Markdown is a little too barebones for writing reports like these, I'd be happier using LaTeX.
- It is understandable that Job had to reserve some time for his Thesis Plan, but it is still unfortunate that it left Erik behind solo in their part of the Assignment. No hard feelings Job, we love you!

## The Ugly

- Alex had to call me on the Saturday morning before the deadline to tell me that we (Alberto and me) were missing the Mars Lander part that Alberto was supposed to write the night before. It got fixed in the end, but it was not a nice way to wake up.

## The Good
- Good communication, everyone was on point contributing to the project and people was willing to work.
- The team was able to respond to feedback quickly and adapt to the changes in the requirements.
- Everyone stuck to the fixed deadlines we established.

## The Bad
- The requirements and goals for the assignment were not clear at all. We had to guess and assume many things about the project.

## The Ugly
- As most of us are part timers, we had to rely a lot on whatsapp, hangouts and remote working.
