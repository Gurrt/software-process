## The Good
- I believe that the majority of the team was very professional and quick to react to questions
- We adjusted well to the change in structure that was suggested by Hans.

## The Bad

- I feel that Markdown is a little too barebones for writing reports like these, I'd be happier using LaTeX.
- It is understandable that Job had to reserve some time for his Thesis Plan, but it is still unfortunate that it left Erik behind solo in their part of the Assignment. No hard feelings Job, we love you!

## The Ugly

- Alex had to call me on the Saturday morning before the deadline to tell me that we (Alberto and me) were missing the Mars Lander part that Alberto was supposed to write the night before. It got fixed in the end, but it was not a nice way to wake up.

It was a bit of a new experience for me to work on the assignment due to most of the part time students only being present on Mondays which means that the day is dedicated entirely to discussion. I tend to take a very passive role when it comes to discussion.

Assigning product owners resulted in smaller groups forming and this made it overall easier to work as there was less communication overhead. This is something that should be done for the next assignment. Especially when its not really possible for everyone to work in the same place.

I believe that the use of Markdown as our document writing format was fine for the most part but that maybe other options should be explored for the next assignment.

The Trello board that was setup did not get used as much. For the next assignment we should consider keeping it more up to date or perhaps use more traditional methods of task management.

Overall, I think everyone did their part to contribute and this assignment went by pretty well.
