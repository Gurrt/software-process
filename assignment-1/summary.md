# Failed Project - Healthcare.gov

## Summary

On 23 March 2010 president Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,[1] better known as Obamacare.
One of the consequences of this law was that everyone in the USA should have access to a insurances exchange, which is a
comparison and enrollment website for health insurance. States are allowed to make their own exchange, but any state that opts out of
making one of their own is allowed access to the exchange created by the federal government, healthcare.gov.

Healthcare.gov launched right on schedule on 1 October 2013. However, as soon as the site launched it was plagued by technical difficulties.
Ranging from only showing gibberish,[2] to including bogus data in applications that is impossible to get rid of.[3] If the site even
worked at all. From the 9.47 million people that tried to sign up only 271,000 succeeded in doing so.[4]
And even if people were able to sign up, their data security was far from guaranteed.[5]
