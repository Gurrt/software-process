#Grading model
Below is the grading rubric for the failed case paper. In total a 100 points can be earned. The total number of points divided by 10 is the grade. E.g. 60 points is the grade 6. The pass mark is 60 points. 

###Grade
The rubric below is already filled in. The <i>italic</i> category is the points we think we ought to get. When we add all the points together (10, 7, 7, 7, 7, 35) we should get 73 points which is the grade 7.3.

| <b>Identification of the complexity  <br> (10 points) | (0 points) <br> There is nothing written about the complexity of the failed project.  | (4 points) <br> There is something written about the complexity, but it is unclear and/or there are no citations or references  | <i> (7 points) <br> There is heading or chapter dedicated about the complexity of the failed project with some detail. Citations and/or references are used. |  (10 points) <br>There is heading or chapter dedicated abo<i>ut the complexity of the failed project with in depth detail. Citations and/or references are used. |
| <b> Analysis of the project organization <br> (10 points) | (0 points) <br>The project organization is not defined | (4 points) <br>The project organization is described, but details are missing   | <i> (7 points) <br> The project organization is described with some details.

There is also no software centric perspective. | <i>(35 points) <br> There is proper analysis of at least two root causes, but some details are still missing. There is a software centric perspective (RUP, Scrum, Marslander), but there are some interpretation mistakes| (100 points) <br>  There is proper analysis of at least three root causes and it is clearly described and visualized using images. There is clear software centric perspective (RUP, Scrum, Marslander) with almost no interpretation mistakes.|
